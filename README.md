# Turist Map

**Turist Map** is an iOS application that displays tourist locations on an interactive map with a clean and modern UI. Users can explore points of interest, view detailed information, and open external resources such as Wikipedia.
## 🌎 Overview

The app presents an interactive map with multiple tourist locations. When the user taps a place—either on the map or from a list—the selected custom pin smoothly enlarges to highlight it. A bottom preview card appears showing:

- A small image of the location  
- Name and city  
- Two action buttons: **Next** and **Learn More**

Tapping **Learn More** opens a detailed sheet that includes:

- A swipeable photo gallery  
- A longer description of the place  
- A small embedded map with zoom, showing the exact position  
- The embedded map has interaction disabled to avoid gesture conflicts and ensure smooth sheet scrolling  
- A tappable **“Read more on Wikipedia”** link that opens the location’s Wikipedia page externally
